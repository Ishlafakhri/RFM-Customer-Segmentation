RFM analysis, standing for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, is a method used to understand and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. This approach can improve effective marketing strategies by analyzing three key factors:

Recency: This measures the time since a customer's last interaction or purchase with the brand. Customers with recent activities are often more engaged and likely to respond to new offers.

Frequency: This assesses how often a customer purchases or interacts with the brand. Frequent buyers typically demonstrate greater loyalty and are crucial targets for retention strategies.

Monetary Value: This looks at the total amount spent by a customer over a specific period. Understanding a customer's spending helps in tailoring offers and recognizing the average expenditure, which is useful for segmenting customers based on their value to the company.

By evaluating these factors, businesses can prioritize customers, customize their marketing efforts, and efficiently allocate resources to maximize customer value and retention.
